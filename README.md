# Chess2pdf

**Free, browser-only chess PDF reader.** Open a chessbook PDF, detect diagrams automatically, correct positions when needed, play out the suggested lines, and get immediate Stockfish evaluation when you deviate — all without uploading anything to a server.

## Features

- **Open any chess PDF** — drag-and-drop or file picker; PDF bytes never leave the browser
- **Local diagram detection** — grid-analysis detects board-like regions with confidence scoring
- **Local OCR** — Tesseract WASM extracts SAN move notation from the page
- **Interactive study board** — react-chessboard with flip, undo, reset, and edit mode
- **Play suggested lines** — step through recognised book moves; deviation is caught immediately
- **Local Stockfish analysis** — Stockfish 18 lite WASM runs in a Web Worker; no server call
- **Edit mode** — place/remove individual pieces to correct any recognised position
- **FEN / PGN clipboard** — copy the current FEN or the parsed PGN; open Lichess in one click
- **IndexedDB sessions** — recognised FENs and move lines are stored locally; original PDFs are not saved
- **No account, no upload route, no telemetry**

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Library |
|---|---|
| Framework | Next.js 16 (App Router, TypeScript) |
| PDF rendering | pdfjs-dist 5 (self-hosted worker) |
| OCR | tesseract.js 7 (WASM, self-hosted assets) |
| Move validation | chess.js 1 |
| Board UI | react-chessboard 5 |
| Engine | Stockfish 18 lite single-threaded WASM |
| Persistence | idb / IndexedDB |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS 4 |
| Tests | Vitest + Playwright |

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Available Scripts

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Start dev server |
| `npm run build` | Production build |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint |
| `npm run test` | Unit tests (Vitest) |
| `npm run test:e2e` | End-to-end tests (Playwright) |

## Security

- PDF bytes are validated against the `%PDF` magic bytes signature before being parsed.
- Maximum file size: 50 MB. Maximum pages: 250.
- OCR output is never injected as HTML.
- All workers and assets are self-hosted; no CDN dependency at runtime.
- Strict Content Security Policy: `default-src 'self'`, `object-src 'none'`, `frame-ancestors 'none'`.
- No upload API route exists. There is no server-side PDF processing.

## Known Limitations

- **Board recognition is best-effort** — v1 uses grid analysis and ink density. It works well for clean digital PDFs; scanned photos and unusual piece fonts need FEN correction.
- **OCR of chess notation** — characters such as `O-O`, `0-0`, `N`, `K`, `x`, `+`, `#` are commonly confused. Always verify parsed moves before serious study.
- **Browser-only processing** — heavy PDFs (200+ pages, large scans) may be slow on older devices.
- **Copyright** — the app processes PDFs you own locally. It does not provide a public PDF library.

## Deploy to Vercel

Push this repo to GitHub, then import it in [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new). No environment variables are required.

```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/chess2pdf.git
git push -u origin main
```

Then connect the repo in Vercel and deploy with default Next.js settings.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Stronger piece classification (ML model trained on chess diagram fonts)
- [ ] Multi-diagram exercise list per page
- [ ] PGN import for exercises without a PDF
- [ ] Mobile-optimised layout
- [ ] PWA / offline support
